# Web3 Security & Protocol Engineer - Journey Log

Hello, I am a recent graduate with a B.S. in Computer Science and Technology. I am currently executing a hands-on, practical learning plan with the goal of becoming a professional Web3 Security Researcher and Protocol Engineer.

I believe that **"Verifiable Work"** triumphs over all else. All of my learning, building, and breaking records are 100% public.
