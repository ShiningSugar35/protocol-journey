# My Web3 Protocol Engineering Journey

This repository documents my 30-day intensive training program to pivot from a general CS background into a specialized Web3 Protocol and Smart Contract Security Engineer.

Following a structured, public-first approach, every commit to this repository represents a verifiable step in mastering the tools, mindsets, and techniques required for professional protocol development.

## Core Focus Areas

* **Smart Contract Security (80%):** Deep-diving into common vulnerabilities, defensive programming patterns, and gas optimization techniques using Foundry.
* **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (20%):** Exploring the fundamentals of ZKPs by implementing basic circuits to build a foundational understanding of this frontier technology.

## Training Log & Key Milestones

This README will be updated as I progress through the [30-Day Protocol Battle Plan](./Web3%20Protocol%20Training%20Plan.docx).

* **Week 1:** Foundations & Tooling (Foundry, Git, Solidity Style)
* **Week 2:** The Attacker's Mindset (Ethernaut Challenges)
* **Week 3:** Defensive Engineering & Gas Optimization
* **Week 4:** Capstone Project - Architecture & Core Logic
* **Week 5:** Capstone Project - Security Hardening
* **Week 6:** Auditing, Documentation & Final Polish

This journey is conducted under the mentorship of my AI Coach, Lanlam. All work is my own, completed within a 2-hour daily timeframe.
